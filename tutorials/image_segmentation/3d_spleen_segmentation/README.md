# Spleen segmentation - FLIP project

Test project for training a model on FLIP for spleen segmentation on 3D CT scans. Uses data from the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD).

Adapted from [this MONAI example](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/tutorials/blob/main/3d_segmentation/spleen_segmentation_3d.ipynb). There's [a more advanced tutorial using `monai_nvflare`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NVFlare/tree/main/integration/monai/examples/spleen_ct_segmentation_sim) but this package or NVFlare version are not currently available on FLIP.

**Versions**: *This project supports NVFlare 2.5.2*
